    <h2>Inside a Computer</h2>
    <h3>How is a <b>Laptop</b> different than a <b>Desktop Computer</b>?</h3>
    <p>
        A laptop has an all-in-one design, with a built-in monitor, keyboard, touchpad, and speakers. It is portable, easier and faster
        in terms of setting it up.
    </p>
    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073157dd48174331f5168_01_17_2014/Inside_Motherboard_v1-02.jpg">
    <p>
        The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive 
        and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). 
        The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>CPU/Processor</h3>
    <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073157dd48174331f5168_01_17_2014/Inside_CPU-02.jpg">
    <p>
        The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes 
        called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an 
        application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PS:</b>
        A processor's speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of 
        instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends 
        on the speed of many different components not just the processor.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
    <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073157dd48174331f5168_01_17_2014/Inside_RAM-02.jpg">
    <p>
        RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until 
        it is needed.
        This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. If you're working on a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file,
        you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PS:</b>
        <p>
            RAM is measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do at the same time.
        </p>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hard Drive</h3>
    <img src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073157dd48174331f5168_01_17_2014/Inside_HardDrive-both-02.jpg">
    <p>
        The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data 
        is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
        The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can start up and load programs.
    </p>

    <h2>What is an OS (Operating System)</h2>
    <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230510120545/OS1.webp">
    <p>
        Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts 
        as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.
        <br>
        In essence, An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for 
        computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions of the OS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ressource Management</li>
        <li>Process Management</li>
        <li>Memory Management</li>
        <li>Device Management</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>Virtualization</li>
        <li>Performance Monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    And a lot more...
    <hr>
    <h3>Examples of OS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows (GUI-based, PC)</li>
        <li>GNU/Linuxs (Personal, Workstations, ISP, File, and print server, Three-tier client/server)</li>
        <li>macOS (Macintosh), used for Apple's personal computers and workstations (MacBook, iMAC)</li>
        <li>Android (Google's Operating System for smartphones/tablets/smartwatches...)</li>
        <li>iOS (Apple's OS for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Virtualization</h2>
    <h3>What is Virtualization</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn3.f-cdn.com/files/download/108501948/d1.png?fit=crop">
    <p>
        Virtualization uses software called <b>hypervisors</b> to create multiple virtual computers (known as <b>virtual machines</b> or VMs) on a single physical machine. These virtual machines can access all the parts of the physical machine, including the computer’s brain or processors, memory and storage.
        <br>
        Each virtual machine runs on its own operating system and functions like a completely separate machine—even though it’s sharing the resources of one physical computer. This is the key feature of virtualization: a single physical machine running multiple tasks simultaneously on different virtual machines, instead of several computers each running a single task.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Types of Virtualization</h3>
    <p>
        There are several types of virtualization, each designed to optimize a specific area or component of computing.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server Virtualization</li>
        <li>Data Virtualization</li>
        <li>Desktop Virtualization</li>
        <li>Storage Virtualization</li>
        <li>Applciation Virtualization</li>
        <li>Network Virtualization</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Benefits of Virtualization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost Savings</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Scalability and Flexibility</li>
    </ul>
    And a lot more...

    <h3>What is a Hypervisor?</h3>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Tf2E1EhQV1Un2v5M2meFsQHaD0?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
    <p>
        A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. 
    </p>

    <h2>Networks: Importance of Network Security</h2>
    <p>
        Network security encompasses all the steps taken to protect the integrity of a computer network and the data within it. Network security is important because it keeps sensitive data safe from cyber-attacks and ensures the network is usable and trustworthy. Successful network security strategies employ multiple security solutions to protect users and organizations from malware and cyber attacks
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is a VPN</h3>
    <img src="https://www.psdgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vpn-shield-icon.jpg">
    <p>
        VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. The encryption takes place in real-time.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>How does a VPN work?</h4>
    <p>
        A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes your data source. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into "gibberish". Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Benefits of a VPN connection</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure Encryption</li>
        <li>Disguising your whereabouts</li>
        <li>Access to regional content</li>
        <li>Secure data transfer</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>How to surf securely with a VPN</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you are online, start your VPN. The VPN acts as a secure tunnel between you and the internet. Your ISP and other third parties cannot detect this tunnel.</li>
        <li>Your device is now on the local network of the VPN, and your IP address can be changed to an IP address provided by the VPN server.</li>
        <li>You can now surf the internet at will, as the VPN protects all your personal data.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.8c1b3b4d7a91ce2153816a8f9611ec19?rik=%2fkJA5E%2ffxct3EQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pc-doktor-blog.de%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f08%2fvpn-fritz-box.jpg&ehk=SYKZ8SM3gK3%2fq6z3pI9nebaQewYfrEWnhgs6rVRQFWY%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
    <hr>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
        A VPN offers a secure and reliable connection over the internet.
        As we all know, your ISP logs all your internet activity, and shares all the logs with other third parties. When using a VPN, your traffic will bypass the ISP as it will go through the VPN.
        Using a VPN ensures that our IP address is hidden (an IP address is briefly our ID on the internet), and the IP address of the VPN server is the one used/visible.
        Our traffic/data is encrypted and protected thanks to the process of encapsulation, with an extra layer of protection, this is called <b>tunneling</b> (creating a virtual tunnel to transfer data).
        With a VPN, we can access restricted content in other countries/locations.
        Another use of VPN is remote working as it provides a secure connection (private network).

    <h3>What is a PROXY</h3>
    <img src="https://networkencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/proxy-server-1024x649.png">
    <p>
        A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network.    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>How does a PROXY work?</h4>
    <p>
        Because a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Benefits of a PROXY server</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced Security</li>
        <li>Private Browsing</li>
        <li>Access to location-specific content</li>
        <li>Prevent employees from browsing inappropriate or distracting sites</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
        A PROXY server retrieves data on the internet on behalf of a user.
        It ensures privacy as it hides your IP address when you want to surf the internet anonymously.
        In terms of speed, a PROXY is faster than a VPN, because a PROXY has something called a cached web page database on its server, ensuring faster response when a user asks for a web page that's already in the cache.
        A PROXY, similar to most network hardware, has activity logging (keeping track of network traffic/activity).
        Compared to a VPN, the proxy doesn't offer data encryption, this is why we can use a VPN with a proxy to ensure a secure tunnel.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Secure Browsing: Be Anonymous Online</h2>
    <p>
        In this section, we talked about the different levels of being anonymous online when accessing the dark net/web.
        <b>PS:</b>
        The dark Web/Net is not only for illegal activities but also for being secure and anonymous when browsing.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>TOR Browser</h3>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.dbf3db5acf165d72ae41d56d373818a3?rik=dE88Ed1sWQ2V9w&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
    <p>
        The Tor browser, also known as the Onion browser or dark web browser, is an abbreviation of the “The Onion Router.” It is a completely free, open-source browser that helps you surf the internet anonymously. It erases your browsing history automatically with every session and encrypts all your traffic.
        <br>
        With Tor, you can access the dark web — the hidden and un-indexed websites on the internet. Tor’s ability to enable users to access the internet freely has led to some countries blocking it entirely.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>How does the TOR browser work?</h4>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*j2aTFBQTd9e1PlFDjeKw1g.jpeg">
    <p>
        When using the Tor browser, your data goes through different Tor servers (or nodes/relays):
        <ul>
            <li>Entry Node</li><p>This is the first node Tor connects with. Your IP address is visible here, but the entry node cannot see what you are connecting with.</p>
            <li>Relay Node</li><p>This node passes along the traffic it receives.</p>
            <li>Exit Node</li><p>This part of the Tor server forwards you to the website you want to see. Your IP address is not visible here, but your destination is.</p>
        </ul>
        The traffic is heavily encrypted at the first node and then slowly decoded — one layer at a time at the different nodes.
        This triple-layered encryption comes with a disadvantage, though. The Tor browser is generally much slower than your bare internet connection. Because your online traffic is sent through different nodes, your internet connection will have to go the long way around and therefore become significantly slower.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>The TOR browser and the Dark Web</h4>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3d131ddb697a702ce3e6a6fbdb4b110e?rik=B0DD9I8p6bSieQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
    <p>
        The Tor browser is one of the best browsers for visiting the dark web anonymously.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>How to Download and Install the Tor Browser </h4>
    <p>
        You can follow this tutorial:
        <a href="https://youtu.be/D6S6uldckxI">Youtube Video - HOW TO INSTALL TOR BROWSER ON KALI LINUX</a>
        <p>
            <b>PS:</b>
            KALI Linux is a similar distribution to PARROT SECURITY.
        </p>
        <br>
        Or follow these steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Browse to this <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">page</a> and click on the penguin.</li>
            <li>If your browser offers to open or save the file, choose the save file option.</li>
            <li>The downloaded file is a .tar.xz file. We need to uncompress and untar it so that we can use its contents.</li>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2">tar -xvJf tor-browser-linux64-8.5.1_en-US.tar.xz</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <li>A new directory will be created in the Downloads folder.</li>
            <li>Tor is successfully installed.</li>
            <li>cd into the new directory and execute this command to start the Tor browser directly from the directory:</li>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2">
                        ./tor-browser_en-US/Browser/start-tor-browser &
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Onion Links</h3>
    <p>
        You can find some Onion Links on these two websites on the dark web:
        <ul>
            <li><b>hidden wiki</b></li>
            <li><b>AHMIA</b></li>
        </ul>    
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Tor with proxychains</h3>
    <h4>Configuring proxychains file</h4>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Dt8Kj_0hcpgZjmDi4C19ZQHaFm?pid=ImgDet&w=724&h=547&rs=1">
    <p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        4 different modes will be displayed, by default you will find the mode used is static dns, comment it with a hashtag "#" and uncomment <b>dynamic</b> mode as we'll be using it.
        <br>
        The main difference between all modes is how your data will be hopping from one proxy server to another, in dynamic mode, as the name says, the traffic will be dynamically transferred between the different proxies (also called a proxy chain: a set of proxies), unlike the static mode which will use the same proxies or the random mode which will randomly choose a proxy from hop to the other.
        <br>
        If you scroll down you will be displayed some proxy names with their IP addresses, the port they use, and sometimes a username and a password of that proxy.
        <br>
        We can even add our own proxies.
        <br>
        A good proxy example is <b>SOCKS5</b>, so an easy way to do it, is to search using tor or whatever browser you want, for "free SOCKS5 proxy list", the first link you will encounter is <a href="https://freeproxyupdate.com/socks5-proxy">this</a>.
        <br>
        When you enter the website, you will have different free proxies from around the world. In order to add one to the <b>proxychains.conf</b> file, scroll down to the bottom of the file, and firstly type:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">SOCKS5 127.0.0.1 9050</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        Then add one or more, from the proxy list you're seeing.
        <br>
        A simple example in our case:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">SOCKS5 192.111.137.34 18765</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        This is a free US SOCKS5 proxy.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Testing our configuration</h4>
    <p>
        As a first, we need to check our public IP address to then notice the changes. Execute this command:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">curl ifconfig.me</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        This will give you the IP address that your browser sees, you can even check it on the browser, just type <b>what is my IP address</b> and you will get the same IP address that you checked via the command.
        <br>
        Now let's put our proxychains configuration into action, execute this command, you can use the Tor service btw, just typing <b>tor</b> in a CLI, and the service will be on, you can check it by typing <b>service tor status</b> and it should be loaded and active.
        <br>
        Now open a new CLI and type this command:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">proxychains firefox dnsleaks</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        This command will open up Firefox via the proxychains, and we specified our website in this command which is <b>dnsleaks</b>. This website will give us our current location and IP address so that we're connected to the internet.
        <br>
        If you configured the file correctly, a different location than yours will pop up, in our case, it was in Germany.
    </p>

    <h4>Configuring a VPN</h4>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.4io7Cqu3QtIDEGYy3HW88QHaEK?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
    <p>
        So before we proceed to configure a VPN connection we need to install some plugins, mainly for our Network Manager:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome -y</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo apt-get install network-manager-pptp -y</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo apt-get install network-manager-pptp-gnome -y</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo apt-get install network-manager-strongswan -y</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">sudo apt-get install network-manager-vpnc -y</td>

        Once done, we can then choose a VPN to install and configure.
        <br>
        So, as we'll be working on free VPNs, let's check this website, <a href="https://www.vpnbook.com/">vpnbook</a>.
        <br>
        Go to <b>OpenVPN</b> section, and then pick a VPN server of your choice and install it, in the session, we used this one:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">Download DE220 Server OpenVPN Config Bundle</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        A .zip file will be downloaded. <br>
        Move to the location where you downloaded the file and execute this command:
        If you ls, a new directory is created, move under it:
        If you ls again, you will have 4 files under that directory, pick one and then execute this command:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">unzip vpnbook-openvpn-de220.zip</td>            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">cd vpnbppd-openvp-de220/</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">openvpn --config vpnbook-de220-tcp443.ovpn</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        You will be prompted to enter a username and then a password:
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Username:<b> vpnbook</b></td>
                <td>Password:<b> b7dh4n3</b></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        These credentials are found on the vpnbook website. And now a successful VPN connection is created.
        <br>
        Once the VPN service is up and running, you can even run the proxychains commands mentioned earlier to ensure an even safer browsing activity and high anonymity, or just keep it simple via the VPN only.
