## 1. Inside a Computer
This section will help you master some of the basic terminology and understand a bit more about what goes on inside a computer.
### How is a laptop different from a desktop?
A laptop has an all-in-one design, with a built-in monitor, keyboard, touchpad, and speakers. It is portable, easier and faster
in terms of setting it up.

### a. Motherboard
The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive 
and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). 
The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.

### b. CPU / Processor
The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes 
called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an 
application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.
#### PS: 
A processor's speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of 
instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends 
on the speed of many different components not just the processor.

### c. RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until 
it is needed.
This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. If you're working on a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file,
you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term storage.
#### PS:
RAM is measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do at the same time.

### d. Hard Drive
The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data 
is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can start up and load programs.

And a lot more...

## 2. What is an OS (Operating System)
Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts 
as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.

In essence, An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for 
computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system.

### Functions of the OS:
  - Ressource Management
  - Process Management
  - Memory Management
  - Security
  - Networking
  - Device Management
  - Virtualization
  - Performance Monitoring
And a lot more...

### Examples of Operating Systems 
  - Windows (GUI-based, PC)
  - GNU/Linux (Personal, Workstations, ISP, File, and print server, Three-tier client/Server)
  - macOS (Macintosh), used for Apple’s personal computers and workstations (MacBook, iMac).
  - Android (Google’s Operating System for smartphones/tablets/smartwatches)
  - iOS (Apple’s OS for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch)
