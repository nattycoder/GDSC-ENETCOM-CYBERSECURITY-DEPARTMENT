    <h2>Inside a Computer</h2>
    <h3>How is a <b>Laptop</b> different than a <b>Desktop Computer</b>?</h3>
    <p>
        A laptop has an all-in-one design, with a built-in monitor, keyboard, touchpad, and speakers. It is portable, easier and faster
        in terms of setting it up.
    </p>
    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    <p>
        The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive 
        and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). 
        The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>CPU/Processor</h3>
    <p>
        The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes 
        called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an 
        application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PS:</b>
        A processor's speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and gigahertz (GHz), or billions of 
        instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends 
        on the speed of many different components not just the processor.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
    <p>
        RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until 
        it is needed.
        This short-term memory disappears when the computer is turned off. If you're working on a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file,
        you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When you save a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as long-term storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>PS:</b>
        <p>
            RAM is measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do at the same time.
        </p>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hard Drive</h3>
    <p>
        The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data 
        is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
        The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can start up and load programs.
    </p>

    <h2>What is an OS (Operating System)</h2>
    <p>
        Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts 
        as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.
        <br>
        In essence, An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for 
        computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions of the OS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ressource Management</li>
        <li>Process Management</li>
        <li>Memory Management</li>
        <li>Device Management</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>Virtualization</li>
        <li>Performance Monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    And a lot more...
    <hr>
    <h3>Examples of OS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows (GUI-based, PC)</li>
        <li>GNU/Linuxs (Personal, Workstations, ISP, File, and print server, Three-tier client/server)</li>
        <li>macOS (Macintosh), used for Apple's personal computers and workstations (MacBook, iMAC)</li>
        <li>Android (Google's Operating System for smartphones/tablets/smartwatches...)</li>
        <li>iOS (Apple's OS for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Virtualization</h2>
    <h3>What is Virtualization</h3>
    <p>
        Virtualization uses software called <b>hypervisors</b> to create multiple virtual computers (known as <b>virtual machines</b> or VMs) on a single physical machine. These virtual machines can access all the parts of the physical machine, including the computer’s brain or processors, memory and storage.
        <br>
        Each virtual machine runs on its own operating system and functions like a completely separate machine—even though it’s sharing the resources of one physical computer. This is the key feature of virtualization: a single physical machine running multiple tasks simultaneously on different virtual machines, instead of several computers each running a single task.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Types of Virtualization</h3>
    <p>
        There are several types of virtualization, each designed to optimize a specific area or component of computing.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server Virtualization</li>
        <li>Data Virtualization</li>
        <li>Desktop Virtualization</li>
        <li>Storage Virtualization</li>
        <li>Applciation Virtualization</li>
        <li>Network Virtualization</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Benefits of Virtualization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cost Savings</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Scalability and Flexibility</li>
    </ul>
    And a lot more...
    <br>
    <h3>What is a Hypervisor?</h3>
    <p>
        A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is a Virtual Machine?</h3>
    <p>
        There are several types of virtualization, each designed to optimize a specific area or component of computing.

    <h2>Networks: Importance of Network Security</h2>
    <p>
        Network security encompasses all the steps taken to protect the integrity of a computer network and the data within it. Network security is important because it keeps sensitive data safe from cyber attacks and ensures the network is usable and trustworthy. Successful network security strategies employ multiple security solutions to protect users and organizations from malware and cyber attacks
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What is a VPN</h3>
    <p>
        VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. The encryption takes place in real time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>How does a VPN work?</h4>
    <p>
        A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into "gibberish". Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Benefits of a VPN connection</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure Encryption</li>
        <li>Disguising your whereabouts</li>
        <li>Access to regional content</li>
        <li>Secure data transfer</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to surf securely with a VPN</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you are online, start your VPN. The VPN acts as a secure tunnel between you and the internet. Your ISP and other third parties cannot detect this tunnel.</li>
        <li>Your device is now on the local network of the VPN, and your IP address can be changed to an IP address provided by the VPN server.</li>
        <li>You can now surf the internet at will, as the VPN protects all your personal data.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>What is a PROXY</h3>
    <p>
        Proxy server refers to a server that acts as an intermediary between the request made by clients, and a particular server for some services or requests for some resources. There are different types of proxy servers available that are put into use according to the purpose of a request made by the clients to the servers. The basic purpose of Proxy servers is to protect the direct connection of Internet clients and internet resources. The proxy server also prevents the identification of the client’s IP address when the client makes any request is made to any other servers.
